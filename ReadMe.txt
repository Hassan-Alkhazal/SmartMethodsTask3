Dear Smart Methods
first of all, I have created IBM chatbot. I created small store who sell icecream and cold drinks. I have inserted several scenario to chat with.
you can chat with him with 3 ways:
1- say what you want direct... (Example: drink). 
2- start with I want .... (Example: I want cold drink)
3- I would like to have ..... (Example: I would like to have cold drink).
I have add it to my page and it is working well.Also, I have added jason file.
regards,
